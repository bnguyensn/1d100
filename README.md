### Hello, world!

This repo contains the source code for my personal website at [bnguyensn.com](https://bnguyensn.com). Everything is public except for the .env file which is not shared ([see why](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#should-i-commit-my-env-file)).
 
 The site is built using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for backend and [React](https://reactjs.org/) for frontend. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is the bundler.
 
 The site is continuously developed. It serves as my code playground as well as a platform for me to explore new ideas. 
 
 I hope you find something useful or learn a thing or two here. I'm available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bnguyensn) if you have questions!
 
 All the best
